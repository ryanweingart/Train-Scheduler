## Overview

Welcome to the Train Scheduler! This application allows the user to enter the name of a specific train, its destination, the first departure time and how frequently the train comes. Each entry will append to the chart that will list the information given and also give the next arrival time and how many minutes away the next train is.

## Information

* Incorporates Firebase to host the information entered by user
* The code retrieves the entries from the user and manipulates the time data using Moment.js
* After data is manipulated, it is appended to the Bootstrap chart
